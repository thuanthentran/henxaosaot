                    We were good, we were gold
                    Kinda dream that can't be sold
                    We were right 'til we weren't
                    Built a home and watched it burn
                    Mm, I didn't wanna leave you
                    I didn't wanna lie
                    Started to cry, but then remembered I
                    I can buy myself flowers
                    Write my name in the sand
                    Talk to myself for hours
                    Say things you don't understand
                    I can take myself dancing
                    And I can hold my own hand
                    Yeah, I can love me better than you can
                    Can love me better
                    I can love me better, baby
                    Can love me better
                    I can love me better, baby
                    Paint my nails cherry red
                    Match the roses that you left
                    No remorse, no regret
                    I forgive every word you said
                    Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby
                    I didn't wanna fight
                    Started to cry, but then remembered I
