                <pre><p style="text-align: center;">
        In case you haven't noticed
        Well, everybody's tired
        And healin' from somebody
        Or somethin' we don't see just right
        Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothin')
        Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
        And if you find yourself in a dark situation
        Just turn on your light and be like
        "Yes, and?"
        Say that shit with your chest, and
        Be your own fuckin' best friend
        Say that shit with your chest
        Keep movin' like, "What's next?"
        "Yes, and?"
        Now I'm so done with caring
        What you think, no, I won't hide
        Underneath your own projections
        Or change my most authentic life
        Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothin')
        Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
        And if you find yourself in a dark situation
        Just turn on your light and be like
        "Yes, and?"
        Say that shit with your chest, and
        Be your own fuckin' best friend
        Say that shit with your chest
        Keep movin' like, "What's next?"
        "Yes, and?"
        My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like
        Protected, sexy, discerning with my time, my time
        Your energy is yours and mine is mine
        What's mine is mine
        My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise
        Don't comment on my body, do not reply
        Your business is yours and mine is mine
        Why do you care so much whose - I ride?
        Why?
        "Yes, and?"
        Say that shit with your chest, and
        Be your own fuckin' best friend
        Say that shit with your chest
        Keep movin' like, "What's next?"
        "Yes, and?"
        "Yes, and?"
        Say that shit with your chest and
        Be your own fuckin' best friend
        Say that shit with your chest
        Keep movin' like, "What's next?"
        "Yes, and?" (Yeah)
